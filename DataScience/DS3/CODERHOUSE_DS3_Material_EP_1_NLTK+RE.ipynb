Pulled into drive through at 8:07 and placed a simple order. I order a regular hamburg and cookies. Once I paid and pulled up to the window to pick up, I  was told to pull up to the #1 space. I sat there and sat there and.........25 minutes later, no order. I  went in and no one was at the counter. I yelled \"hello\" three times. A young lady came up asking who was handling the front counter. A young girl appeared. To make this complaint shorter, I  showed my receipt and another 5 minutes later I got my order. There was another order with a drink sitting on the counter that never got to the person who ordered it. After getting home, I  had no regular hamburg but had cookies. Everyone, don't even bother going to this location again. It's a horrible experience every time as you can see by other reviews.   \n",

The staff here is always friendly and ALWAYS get their orders correct. By far one of the best McDs I have ever been to. I always enjoy and appreciate quality service from quality people... and you'll definitely find it here. At least from the evening crew. Haven't been here during the day. My girls joke that I go here so often to get them food, that the staff is going to end up knowing me and having their order ready to go. Lmao Great people and excellent service. ï¿½ï   \n",

Night crew is a whole different experience, lines down the street, hour long waits. If this was a one time occurrence it wouldn't be so bad but this is a nightly problem. Beyond this the staff is so highly rude you leave wanting to crash your car through the building. Don't forget they will mistake your order almost every single time as well and serve it to you cold.   \n",

Went from drive thru and employee directly asks what do you want. He keeps rushing while taking order with no other cars placing order. We wanted to add one more item and asked for a minute. He keeps asking what else. When I said we are ready - no response. There were no other car placing order that time either. I told again we are ready. responded after a pause. Again what do you want... excuse me.. who talks to customers like this ??\\nI asked for his name to put a review and he flat out denied. I asked for receipt before handing my credit card. He swipes it and returns back my card. I m waiting for a receipt with my family in the car. He starts inputing another order on his tablet. Waited for sometime and then I waive my hand several times. He opens window and said you can get receipt from next window. Excuse me ??\\nWent to next window - picked up food, asked for Manager and got his name JAMAR. My receipt states 08/06/2022 7:20pm Order 05\\nI didn't want to complain but this was intolerable.   \n",
              "21  Meh.. just meh. When I finally get the correct order, it is generally tasty. I'm a picky eater, and have found ways to navigate the menu to get items I like. Worked in the service industry for years as a server, bartender, and trainer. Taking and fulfilling orders is NOT hard, tedious at times though. I only go here when I see they are not busy, in hope that my order is correct when I go to leave. In the 10 times that I have been here in the past past year, I have only had 1 order that was perfectly correct. Just ONE, not an exaggeration. That one order was just 2 large fries and nothing else. Though I will mention that when I got home and pulled them out of the bag, they were hardly what you'd call filled, (nor did I enjoy any on the 3 minute drive home) so little so that I even sent a picture and post to McDonald's on Facebook, at least the few were hot. The evening staff is very pleasant, but the morning staff leaves a lot to be desired, as well as thinking that they can talk negatively about people in Spanish out in the open which, being a light skinned Puerto Rican, I understand perfectly. I have submitted several complaints and NEVER received a call or email back. I just don't go here anymore to avoid the stress of paying money for something that is most likely wrong.   \n",

According to Google they're open 24/7. Finally we pull up to the window to see if anyone was there, sure enough one employee seated in the lobby and another at the window. She told me they were closed. Whoever these two are they need to be replaced. Get it together McDonald's. You're a corporate power house and you have a reputation to keep.

They gave me a small portion for what I paid for.  This is not right and management needs to correct this.  Stealing from customers is plain wrong.  When ordering a large, they expect to get what should come in a large.  I noticed after my bad experience that your reviews are low.  In order order to create a good business, giving people an exceptional experience should be your goal not the opposite.   \n",

I sat in the drive thru for almost an hour waiting to get my order taken, the line was wrapped almost TWICE around the building, and finally I gave up and tried driving up to the window to give them my order since i was next in line. When i got to the window, they told me they couldn't take it and I'd have to go back around. I told them I'd like to put in my order here since I've been waiting all this time, and they proceeded to still refuse and that it's my fault for waiting in the second lane that they claimed was closed and had a sign out. The second lane was open, and the \"sign\" they were talking about was a wet floor sign they had placed right next to the drive-thru menu. I told them the lane looked open from our side and they still proceeded to argue with me, and then slammed the drive thru window shut. I've never received such deplorable customer service in my life, and if any managers are reading this, I highly suggest firing the two workers from last night.   \n",

              "21  meh.. just meh. when i finally get the correct order, it is generally tasty. i'm a picky eater, and have found ways to navigate the menu to get items i like. worked in the service industry for years as a server, bartender, and trainer. taking and fulfilling orders is not hard, tedious at times though. i only go here when i see they are not busy, in hope that my order is correct when i go to leave. in the 10 times that i have been here in the past past year, i have only had 1 order that was perfectly correct. just one, not an exaggeration. that one order was just 2 large fries and nothing else. though i will mention that when i got home and pulled them out of the bag, they were hardly what you'd call filled, (nor did i enjoy any on the 3 minute drive home) so little so that i even sent a picture and post to mcdonald's on facebook, at least the few were hot. the evening staff is very pleasant, but the morning staff leaves a lot to be desired, as well as thinking that they can talk negatively about people in spanish out in the open which, being a light skinned puerto rican, i understand perfectly. i have submitted several complaints and never received a call or email back. i just don't go here anymore to avoid the stress of paying money for something that is most likely wrong.   \n",

              "21  meh just meh when i finally get the correct order it is generally tasty im a picky eater and have found ways to navigate the menu to get items i like worked in the service industry for years as a server bartender and trainer taking and fulfilling orders is not hard tedious at times though i only go here when i see they are not busy in hope that my order is correct when i go to leave in the 10 times that i have been here in the past past year i have only had 1 order that was perfectly correct just one not an exaggeration that one order was just 2 large fries and nothing else though i will mention that when i got home and pulled them out of the bag they were hardly what youd call filled nor did i enjoy any on the 3 minute drive home so little so that i even sent a picture and post to mcdonalds on facebook at least the few were hot the evening staff is very pleasant but the morning staff leaves a lot to be desired as well as thinking that they can talk negatively about people in spanish out in the open which being a light skinned puerto rican i understand perfectly i have submitted several complaints and never received a call or email back i just dont go here anymore to avoid the stress of paying money for something that is most likely wrong  \n",
